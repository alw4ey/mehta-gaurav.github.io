In an effort to support the planning and response efforts for the recent Coronavirus outbreak,
the [Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC)](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/nssac)
division of the [Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/) 
at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) has prepared a visualization tool that provides an alternate way of examining data curated by [JHU](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/daily_case_updates) and NSSAC. For a quick overview, please see the video below:

[![COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard](videoimage.png)](https://youtu.be/xJWTc3bo8q4 "COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard")

Key features of our tool include:

- A visualization of all reported Coronavirus incidence data, filtered by date;
- A heatmap of selected attributes on an interactive map;
- A Query tool that allows users to focus on regions of interest;
- The ability to select regions by clicking on the map; to select multiple regions at once, hold the "command" key on the Mac or the "ctrl" key on Windows while clicking;
- Users can export subsets of the data for analysis on external tools.

We hope our tool will encourage researchers worldwide to explore the surveillance datasets 
made available by the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases), [NHC](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/new_list.shtml), and [DXY](https://3g.dxy.cn/newh5/view/pneumonia), and curated by [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and us. 

**Supported Browsers**: Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, iPad and mobile.

### Updates

##### 02/20/2020
We are happy to release a new version of our dashboard with a time slider which makes it easy to see all the historical data for the COVID-19 outbreak. It also makes it easier to spot data issues. We are working on some small display issues/improvements, which is why we consider this version a beta release. Please let us know if you find any issues with the tool or the underlying data. Thanks!

##### 02/14/2020
We are very grateful to JHU CSSE for their great contribution by releasing their curated data for COVID-19. Due to recent changes to JHU CSSE's data release plan, we have switched to our own data, curated from tencent.com and other websites cited in the Data section of our tool.

##### 02/12/2020

We are happy to release our first official version -- version 0.8.0 -- today.
