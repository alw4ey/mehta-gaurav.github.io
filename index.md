Welcome to the [Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC)](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/nssac)'s collaboration page.  A division of the [Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative (BII)](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). We use advanced modeling techniques and simulations to study real world, cross-discipline problems.  Our focus areas include Cognitive and Social Behaviors, Interdependent Infrastructures (like transportation and social media), Systems Biology, and Public Health (including epidemics and pandemics).  This page provides access to materials relevant to current topics of interest in order to foster communication and collaboration. For more information about our research, please see our [main webpage](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/nssac).
